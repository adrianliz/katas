## Description

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Players take turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) in
an empty square.

Player X always goes first.

If a player is able to place three of their symbols in a row, column or diagonal,
they win the game.

If there is no empty square available, and no player has won, the game is a draw.
